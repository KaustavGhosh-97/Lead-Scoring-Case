# Lead Scoring Case Study
  ## **Overview**
    This repository contains files and code for the Lead Scoring Case Study, aimed at analyzing and improving lead conversion rates using data-driven insights. The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, logistic regression modeling, and actionable recommendations.

  ## **Contents**
    Assignment Subjective Questions.pdf: Contains subjective questions related to the case study.
    Lead_Scoring_case_study.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the code for data cleaning, EDA, modeling, and evaluation.
    Lead_scoring_case_study.pdf: A detailed report summarizing the findings and methodologies used in the case study.
    Summary Report.pdf: A concise presentation of results and recommendations.

  ## **Motivation**
    The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to identify leads most likely to convert into customers. This helps optimize marketing efforts and improve resource allocation.

  ## **Methodology**
    ### 1. Data Cleaning:
      a. Handling missing values.
      b. Removing irrelevant columns.
      c. Encoding categorical variables.
    ### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
      a. Analyzing trends in lead conversion rates.
      b. Identifying key factors influencing lead conversion.
    ### 3. Modeling:
      a. Logistic Regression to predict lead conversion probability.
      b. Feature selection based on statistical significance.
    ### 4. Evaluation:
      a. Confusion matrix, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity.
      b. ROC curve analysis.
      
  ## **Results**
    a. Top 3 factors influencing lead conversion:
    b. Lead Origin: Lead Add Form
    c. Lead Source: Welingak Website
    d. Last Activity: Had a Phone Conversation
  **Recommendations** provided to optimize lead conversion strategies.
